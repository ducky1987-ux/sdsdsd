## Physical Layer Details

### Modulation Techniques

#### DSSS (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum)
- Used by 802.11b
- Spreads signal across entire frequency band
- Robust but lower data rates

#### OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing)
- Used by 802.11a/g/n/ac/ax
- Splits signal into multiple sub-carriers
- Better spectrum efficiency
- Higher data rates

### Data Rates and Modulation Schemes

Each standard uses different modulation for different data rates:
- **BPSK** - Lowest rate, most robust
- **QPSK** - Moderate rate
- **16-QAM** - Higher rate
- **64-QAM** - Even higher rate
- **256-QAM** (802.11ac) - Very high rate
- **1024-QAM** (802.11ax) - Highest rate

## Channel Management

### 2.4 GHz Channels (US/EU)
- Channels 1-13 (some regions use 1-14)
- Each channel is 5 MHz wide
- Channels overlap significantly
- Non-overlapping: 1, 6, 11

### 5 GHz Channels
- Many non-overlapping channels
- Better channel utilization
- Less interference

### Channel Bonding
- Combining adjacent channels for higher bandwidth
- 40 MHz, 80 MHz, 160 MHz options in newer standards
- Higher speeds but requires more spectrum
